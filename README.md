Healthy brains for a healthy tomorrow !

## Inspiration
Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health.

Looking around, we saw a lot of people facing issues with their mental health. Thus, we tried to provide a platform for people to cope with this.

## What it does
PiedPipper is a one stop solution for people facing issues with mental health. Its features not only provide temporary laughs, but allow you to contact a professional if you feel the need to do so.

Some features of PiedPipper are:
1. Gaming Section: A collection of mood lightening games when one is feeling tired.
2. Get a Call: Contact nearest psychiatrist, if you feel the need to talk to someone.
3. Meme Section: Laughter is the strongest medicine. It takes away all the mental pressure in a second. Feeling stressed? Enjoy some funny memes.
4. Self assessment Quiz: Not sure, if you are facing issues with your mental health? Attempt quizzes to find it out. Based on the scores, you can take necessary action. 
5. Consult a doctor: If you feel the need for treatment, consult a doctor as soon as possible. Mental health is not something to be taken lightly.
6. Music Therapy: Research shows the benefits of music therapy for various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, autism, trauma, and schizophrenia. Music acts as a medium for processing emotions, trauma, and grief, but music can also be utilised as a regulating or calming agent for anxiety or mood dysregulation. We have a collection of light music podcasts to freshen up the mood in case a person is not feeling well.

## How we built it
The light games were built using unity. Javascript was used to embed music podcast. We used mongodb to store details of user. We used express.js for the backend and html5 and css for frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was to analyse what exact problems people actually face while having a depression or mental illness. After studying that, we came up with solutions that help people to cope up with such problems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The world is a happy place but still there are a huge bunch of people suffering from depression and anxiety and according to WHO, there are approximately 264 million people who suffer from depression or any other mental illness. This number has increased due to 300 million during this Covidâ€™19 pandemic. We are happy that we could address such a large problem and help people to cope up with that.
 
## What we learned
We learned the current scenario of mental health in the world and how diversely covid'19 has made an impact on the world. We learned how to integrate music podcast and unity games in the web application. We also learned how to use web books.

## What's next for Pied-Piper
We plan to incorporate an automated chat-bot to guide people for all their needs and provide the resources needed.
